# Learning machine learning from tutorials

This repository aims to explore and understand the core concepts of machine learning through step-by-step tutorials provided from machine learning open-source libraries / frameworks.

## List of open-source libraries / frameworks

- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) - TensorFlow tutorials utilize [Keras API](https://keras.io/), which built on top of TensorFlow version 2, that enable beginners to easily build neural network model by adding built-in layers into the Keras Sequential model to carry out machining learning tasks. For advanced experts, Keras provides functional and subclassing model API to support more flexible model creation and customization. For more information, visit [Keras docs](https://keras.io/api/). 

## Tutorials

- TensorFlow tutorials that I have worked on are all under the directory [here](./tensorflow_tutorials). One thing you have to keep in mind is that tutorials in this repository are slightly different from TensorFlow since they are modified by me and a lot of codes and markdowns are condensed for ease of reference. If you are interested, visit [TensorFlow tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials) or [TensorFlow docs](https://github.com/tensorflow/docs) to learn diverse machine learning tutorials in details.
