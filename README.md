#  Machine Learning

This repository has all of my works on machine learning that I've studied by myself so far. Each jupyter notebook describes a certain topic of machine learning such as linear regression, multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and recurrent neural network (RNN). A more interesting topics of machine learning / deep learning will be posted to this remote repository! ðŸ˜„
