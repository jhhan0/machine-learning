# Learning machine learning

This repository aims to explore and understand the core concepts of machine / deep learning through step-by-step tutorials provided from open-source libraries / frameworks and [Python Machine Learning 3rd Edition](https://www.gilbut.co.kr/book/view?bookcode=BN002431) (Korean Translation).

- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) - TensorFlow tutorials utilize [Keras API](https://keras.io/), which built on top of TensorFlow version 2, that enable beginners to easily build neural network model by adding built-in layers into the Keras Sequential model to carry out machining learning tasks. For advanced experts, Keras provides functional and subclassing model API to support more flexible model creation and customization. For more information, visit [Keras docs](https://keras.io/api/). 

## Tutorials

- TensorFlow tutorials that I have worked on are all under the directory [here](./tensorflow_tutorials). One thing you have to keep in mind is that tutorials in this repository are a bit modified (eg. additional features are included or I skipped unnecessary parts) and some lines of code and markdown are condensed for ease of reference. If you are interested to learn from the official website, visit [TensorFlow tutorials page](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials) or [TensorFlow docs github](https://github.com/tensorflow/docs) to explore TensorFlow's state-of-the-art tutorials in details.

## Textbook

- [Python Machine Learning 3rd Edition](https://www.gilbut.co.kr/book/view?bookcode=BN002431) lets you introduce and understand the mathematical theories and algorithms behind the machine / deep learning using the real-world practical examples. All the tutorials inside this textbook are coded based on the [Python](https://python.org/) language with essencial machine / deep learning libraries such as [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), and [Numpy](https://numpy.org/). You can find textbook tutorials under the directory [here](./python_machine_learning_textbook).
